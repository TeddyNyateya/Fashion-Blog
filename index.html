    <p>As long as male elegance is in season, the well-tailored suit will always have a place in the stylish man’s wardrobe. However, like other symbols of masculine formality, the destiny of this long-established pillar of male decorum continues in flux. Much like the tuxedo with its promise of elevating the wearer to his most Hollywood handsome, the same can be said of the classic suit. When well cut and knowledgeably accessorized, the tailored jacket and matching trouser continue to frame a man through a prism of sartorial heritage.

In terms of being able to offer a complete yet variable envelope for the male physique, the single-breasted, two-button jacket model has no peer. With shoulders designed to frame the head and broaden the shoulder line, an athletic V-shaped chest flowing down to a defined waistline, up-sweeping and elongating lapels that promote the illusion of height, tapering long sleeves that mirror the trimming line of the jacket, and pockets placed for function and form ….the properly proportioned tailored jacket will redress the uneven and counterbalance the unshapely like no other item of clothing. This may explain why it’s able to transcend fashion, place, time, and taste to offer men and women the ability to both flaunt and camouflage themselves.

The classically cut suit will always offer a man a vision of himself that no other housing can. It’s hard to foresee a time when a man will not want to be reminded of his most debonair self. There’s a moment after putting on a fine suit appointed with the right finery when you turn to look in the mirror and flash back to a moment of discovery, like when you first saw Paris at night or had your first martini. And there’s a smidgen of self-congratulation, a feeling of praise.

So far the fashion world, after many, many decades in the making, have yet to come up with a credible alternative to the man peacocked in all his suit-silhouetted regalia. Call me a sartorial romantic, but I am prepared to bet the proverbial bankbook that they never will….and the world will be better for it.”</p>
